# Camera Tilt

### What does this tool do?
This tool measures the horizon camera tilt and places an HUD on the bottom-right of the viewport.
This is great to use with the [`camera_distance`](../camera_distance) script.

### How to use?
1. Change the variable on the `CAM_NAME` with camera.
2. Change the variable on the `FLOOR_POINT_NAME` with the empty that you have placed.
3. Click on the viewport to refresh HUD.
4. To turn off HUD, run the script again and repeat step 3.
